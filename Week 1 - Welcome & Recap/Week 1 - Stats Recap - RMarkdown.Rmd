## Datatypes Review

  Below you will find a table of how best to measure and analyzed different data types against each other: 

![](./Data-Types.png)

Using RStudio and the *'data sample.sav'* or the *'data sample.csv'* data file provided on black board or using the RStudio work space provided, we will move through these different data type comparisons.  

## Importing Data

To import the data files provided, you will need to use the commands required for each file type. 

### *'.sav'* File

  To import a native SPSS *'.sav'* file, you must first import a library of functions called haven to properly analyze it. Then you can use the import the data to the variable name of your choice. See below:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(haven)
data_sample <- read_sav("data sample.sav")
```

### *'.csv'* File

  Importing a *'.csv'* file doesn't require any additional libraries but may require some extra data manipulation to have the variable and scale labels readable in some of the analyses. 
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
data_sample <- read.csv("data sample.csv")
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
