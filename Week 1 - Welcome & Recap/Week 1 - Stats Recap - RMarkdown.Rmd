## Datatypes Review

  Below you will find a table of how best to measure and analyzed different data types against each other: 

![](./Data-Types.png)

Using RStudio and the *'data sample.sav'* or the *'data sample.csv'* data file provided on black board or using the RStudio work space provided, we will move through these different data type comparisons.  

## Importing Data

To import the data files provided, you will need to use the commands required for each file type. 

### *'.sav'* File

  To import a native SPSS *'.sav'* file, you must first import a library of functions called haven to properly analyze it. Then you can use the import the data to the variable name of your choice. See below:
  
```{r import, eval = TRUE}
library(haven)
data_sample <- read_sav("data sample.sav")
```

### *'.csv'* File

  Importing a *'.csv'* file doesn't require any additional libraries but may require some extra data manipulation to have the variable and scale labels readable in some of the analyses. 
  
```{r eval - FALSE}
data_sample <- read.csv("data sample.csv")
```


## Preparing the Data

  No matter which data format you use you will need to reassign the lables that are in the the imported dataset. To do this, we need a new library that will required an installation.
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages(expss)
```

  Then using that library we can apply the appropriate labels. 
```{r eval = TRUE}
likert_five = c("Strongly Disagree" = 1, "Disagree" = 2, "Niether Agree nor Disagree" = 3, "Agree" = 4, "Strongly Agree" = 5)
weekly_hours = c("0" = 1, "1-5" = 2, "6-10" = 3, "11-20" = 4, "21-40" = 5, "41-100" = 6, "more than 100" = 7)
frequency = c("Never" = 1, "Less than 3 times a week" = 2, "4-10 times a week" = 3, "11-20" = 4, "more than 20 times a week" = 5)

data_sample = apply_labels(data_sample,
                      Romance = likert_five,
                      Scifi = likert_five,
                      commutetime = weekly_hours,
                      peopleaday = weekly_hours[1:5],
                      smilesaday = frequency,
                      renting = c("Rent" = 1, "Own" = 2),
                      Fitnesspriority = c("Physical Fitness" = 1, "Look Good" = 2),
                      Weatherchecker = frequency,
                      Newsreader = frequency,
                      Cookalot = frequency,
                      WorkoutFreq = frequency,
                      HealthyeatFreq = frequency,
                      Single = c("Not Single" = 1, "Single" = 2),
                      Romantictime = c("<30 hours a week" = 1, "31-45 hours a week" = 2, "61-80 hours a week" = 4, "more than 81 hours a week" = 5),
                      Preffirstdate = c("Walk by the river" = 1, "Coffee at a cafe" = 2, "Visit a museum" = 3, "See a movie" = 4)
)

rm(frequency, likert_five, weekly_hours)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
